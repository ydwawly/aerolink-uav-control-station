A change to the sequence number indicates that the set of AVAILABLE_MODES has changed, and that the receiver should re-request all available modes.

        The message is optional, and is only needed when the set of modes can change dynamically after boot.
        It should be emitted whenever the set of modes change.
        It should be streamed at low rate (nominally 0.3 Hz).
        See https://mavlink.io/en/services/standard_modes.html
